In this part ,we would use [Candle software](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle) to control the [DIY CNC machine](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.85.736a3286COaS7g&id=605504955634&ns=1&abbucket=18#detail)
 

We need to run the 4 programs one by one ,the method is simiar(only difference is cutter),so we just introduce one program

* 1 Open the file we need,and then we can find the nc coding and path
* 2 Use "Jog" function to move spindle to postion we need. In this case ,we need the corner of the board as the following picture
* 3 Use "XY home" and "Z home" to define home position
